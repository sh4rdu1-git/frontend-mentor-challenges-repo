## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had a revision of some of the concepts like padding, margins, use of flexbox.

### Continued development

I am still not that comfortable with paddings and margins for making proper layout. Also, the methods of setting lengths other than pixels (like em, rem) are still something that I have never used before. So I am going to pay more attention on those things.
