## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through ths challenge, I was able to learn how to structure HTML markup for diffecrent sections of the page. I have tried using semantic HTML tags for defining elements of the page. For styling the page, I have used plain CSS and used Flexbox for the arrangement. For the effect on hovering the mouse pointer on a button, I used `:hover` CSS pseudo-class.

```css
.link a {
  color: var(--color-white);
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 600;
}

.link:hover a {
  color: var(--color-darkgrey);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my responsive design skills and get comfortable with different CSS units used for the spacing and styling.
